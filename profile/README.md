# Comit√© √âco: Digital Infrastructures for Ecological Transformation

Welcome to Comit√© √âco's Git Organization! We are dedicated to catalyzing ecological change in local communities and territorial authorities. Our project focuses on providing essential digital infrastructures that empower communities to manage an active ecological transformation of their urban areas. We believe in accelerating this transition at scale by leveraging network effects and fostering collaboration among local stakeholders. Here's an overview of our digital infrastructure components:

## 1. Territorial Profile
The **Territorial Profile** is a unique user profile for public and select private services and equipment available locally. Unlike conventional digital profiles, individual personal and user data are stored securely in private data pods, encrypted and accessible only by the user. We prioritize Privacy-by-Design technologies, such as homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof protocols, ensuring user identity and privacy are preserved.

## 2. Territorial Ecology Graph
The **Territorial Ecology Graph** represents the Local Urban Metabolism, integrating sustainable urban design principles. Leveraging data from the Territorial Profile, this graph provides a dynamic statistical representation of the local metabolism, promoting circularity of resources and waste for a minimal environmental footprint.

## 3. Algorithms of Ecological Potential
Our **Algorithms of Ecological Potential** evaluate local contexts, highlighting areas for positive change in the metabolism. By identifying opportunities, such as supporting key services or enabling synergies between local actors, we offer actionable challenges to the community. We continuously expand our database of 'ecological actions' to promote circularity and sustainability.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to foster ecological change within the community. We collaborate extensively with communities, associations, and institutions, connecting initiatives and reinforcing their impact. We envision an urban environment reinvented through fairness, inclusivity, and sustainability. Mastering digital platforms and harnessing their power for environmental transition is fundamental to our approach.

## Democratic Governance: Data Cooperative
We operate within a democratic framework called **'Data Cooperative'**, where local participants can review, comment, and deliberate on project developments. This innovative governance structure empowers citizens on digital topics, allowing them to appreciate the dangers, impact, and value of the digital realm. We are working closely with CNIL, the French authority on digital governance, to establish this groundbreaking initiative.

Join us in our journey towards a greener, fairer, and more sustainable future! üå±üåç
